# Assignment 01 - PROG2007
This repo is part of a delivert in Assignments 1 in Mobile programming (PROG2007) - NTNU.
> In task 1, you will design and implement a terminal-based Kotlin application without a GUI. 
> In task 2, you will implement one mobile screen where a GUI is supported, using Kotlin with Jetpack Compose.

## File structure
Task 1 and 2 are seperated by two folders. To run each program `cd` into the respective folder.
To be able to run the two seperate tasks, remember to open the project-folder in your IDE (like IntelliJ or Android Studio) - **NOT the git-project-folder**. 

## Task 1
The purpose of task 1 is to get to know Kotlin, the programming language. 
The code itself definietly have little-to-none consistency as I would code and learn as the program was being developed - Learning good and bad practices, and hopefully get rid of some of the bad ones along the way.

### Safety and input sanitazion
The code is not meant to be deployed in its current state as especially error-hendling and user-inputs are not being handled and sanitized correctly. This is not a requirement for the task itself, although there is some being done sanitizing and error-handling. This is not the goal of the task.

## Task 2
The goal of task 2 is to play around in Android Studio and Jetpack Compose. 
Specifically the the task would require the following: 
- Row
- Column
- TextField (any text field type is okay)
- At least one clickable Button
- Text elements
