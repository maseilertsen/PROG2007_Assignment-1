# Assignment 01 - PROG2007
This repo is part of a delivert in Assignments 1 in Mobile programming (PROG2007) - NTNU.
> In task 1, you will design and implement a terminal-based Kotlin application without a GUI. In task 2, you will implement one mobile screen where a GUI is supported, using Kotlin with Jetpack Compose.

## File structure
Task 1 and 2 are seperated by two folders. To run each program `cd` into the respective folder. 

## Task 1
The purpose of task 1 is to get to know Kotlin, the programming language. 
The code itself definietly have little-to-none consistency as I would code and learn as the program was being developed - Learning good and bad practices, and hopefully get rid of some of the bad ones along the way.
The code is not meant to be deployed in its current state as especially error-hendling and user-inputs are not being handled and sanitized correctly. This is not a requirement for the task itself, although there is some being done sanitizing and error-handling.

### Safety and input sanitazion

I have not fully proofed this project due to time restrictions spent on this project. This project is not meant to be deployed in any way or form, so the sanitizing of user input will not meet requirements expected in a real-world scenario.  
## Task 2
`TODO`
